# Horiseon Social Solutions landing Page

This is a landing page for Horiseon Social Solution Services. The webpage features the core services that the company offers with links to more in-depth pages.

I was tasked with refactoring this web page, and have included the following changes:
- replaced vague HTML elements with semantic ones.
- added "title" attributes to div elements, improving accesibility and SEO.
- moved HTML & CSS code around on their respective documents so they follow a more consistant structure.
- added alt info on all images and icons.
- verified all headings fall in sequential order.
- adjusted the title to be more relevant to the webpage.
